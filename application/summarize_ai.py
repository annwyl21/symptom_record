    Perform the following actions:
    - Summarise the text delimited by triple backticks with a focus on change over time in symptoms, eg which are worsening or improving and whether the person experiences pain every day. This concise summary is intended to be spoken by a person trying to convey their symptoms using easy to understand language without clauses.
    1. find out relevant symptoms from the information provided.
    2. then, summarise the text provided in simple, short sentences.
    3. Identify the status of symptoms, are they improving or worsening?
    4. Separate your answers with line breaks.
    5. Reread your summary before you return it to me and check that all the symptoms described do exist in the original text provided.
    Use the following format:
    Summary: <short summary using 'I'>
    Status: <status>
    Time period: <time period in days>
    Text:```""" + symptom_history + "```",
